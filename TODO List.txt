Updated: 13Jun
Features Addition

-Connection (Inspects IP & UUID checks for bans / Checks for invalid packets)
-If IPban bypass, and UUID ban found, Ban new IP.
-Hook into the configuration process


Features:
Console access that will hold message printing while using menu
SQLLite for player, uuid, ip and ban storage
Plug-ins Frame Work (Java plug-ins (.jars) and potentially LUA Plug-in support)
Localization flexibility and plug-in Localization option
Modify language language org.starnub.configuration to use main org.starnub.configuration

Packet Classes/Netty Handlers - Client ID and Client Class

(Possible Features)
Performance Monitoring Option
Remote Console/Web Interface

Fixes:

Debug Additions:
Benchmark - Process Time and Proxy Bandwidth

Configurable:
StarNub Port
Starbound Port
Restart Timer

Channel 2: Client <- Server 
[Backend#0, DefaultChannelPipeline$TailHandler#0]

video 29.00 ByteBufferProcessor important for searching byte buffer
alloc() over unpooled buffer
slice() or duplicate() over copy
bulk operation over loops

video 44.00 write and write flush multiple operations make runnable
channel.eventLoop().execute(new Runnable(){..}

video 48.00 remove handlers
 
 
Performance Monitor + recording tp database for evaluations

long end = System.currentTimeMillis ();
System.out.println ("Time taken for execution is " + (end ï¿½ start));


IPs list of 61K IP's to test the performance of banned IP checks. It took only .27 seconds (270 milliseconds) to load the 61K addresses. When a I connected it took only .9 Seconds (900 milliseconds) to check the connecting IP against all 61K addresses. Ok back to work!

 //TODO BUG from starbound with player names and underscores or not matching names, crash on ship warp..

List for later:
Refractor the parts used from bukkit+paste in credits for bukkits open source code, once schedualer and events are placed in StarNub Style.
